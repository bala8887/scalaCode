1) Missed = between return type of a function and {
  for example, "def main() : Unit = {" written without = "def main() : Unit {"
2) try/catch block, no need for match statement. directly case can be written without match
3) if we want to catch all throwables, then make case _ : throwables. this is a good practice.
   if "Throwable" hasn't been provided, then the code throws an exception.
   warning: This catches all Throwables. If this is really intended, use `case _ : Throwable` to clear this warning.
                case _ => println("exception")
